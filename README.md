#1.1 Project Background
We are computer science student currently on semester break and working part-time at a retail company named GoldenHour, a watch retailer located in Kuala Lumpur City Centre. Due to our academic background in computer science, the management assigned us the task of designing and implementing an operations management system for the store. This project provides an opportunity to apply programming and system design knowledge in a real-world retail environment while gaining valuable practical experience.

#1.2 Problem Statement
At present, GoldenHour relies on manual and non-integrated methods to manage employee attendance, stock tracking, and sales transactions. These methods are inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Without a centralized system, it is difficult to maintain accurate records, monitor stock movements, verify sales transactions, and analyze employee and sales performance effectively.

#1.3 Project Objectives
The main objective of this project is to develop an Operations Management System that supports and improves daily operations at GoldenHour. The specific objectives are to:
Provide secure employee login and role-based access
Record employee attendance and calculate working hours
Manage stock levels, daily stock counts, and stock movements
Record sales transactions accurately and update inventory automatically
Store and retrieve operational data efficiently
